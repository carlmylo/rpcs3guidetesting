That's it! You now (hopefully) have set up Rock Band 3 on your PC. While you're here, why not join some communities that are helping keep the Rock Band community alive?

Milohax are the developers of the must-have Rock Band 3 Deluxe mod that I cannot recommend enough. **[\[Download here\]](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/)**. On top of [[the many features it adds]](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/features), they also have developed mods for [Guitar Hero 1](https://github.com/Milohax-archive/Guitar-Hero-Deluxe), [Guitar Hero 2 (both the Xbox 360](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/Guitar-Hero-II-Deluxe-360) and [PS2 version](https://github.com/Milohax-archive/Guitar-Hero-Deluxe)s), [Dance Central 1](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/dance-central-1-deluxe), [Dance Central 3](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/dance-central-3-deluxe), [Rock Band 1](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-1-deluxe), [Rock Band 2](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/), [Lego Rock Band](https://github.com/Milohax-archive/lego-rock-band-deluxe), [Green Day Rock Band](https://github.com/Milohax-archive/greenday-rock-band-deluxe), [Rock Band Blitz](https://github.com/Milohax-archive/rock-band-blitz-deluxe), and [The Beatles: Rock Band](https://github.com/Milohax-archive/beatles-rock-band-deluxe)

**RBEnhanced:**

Developers of the amazing RBEnhanced mod that currently only exists for Xbox 360 and Wii. The same developers also help run and maintain the GoCentral server that is the original online revival server for Rock Band 3. Without this, this game would be more or less dead and the entire online portion of this guide wouldn't exist.
