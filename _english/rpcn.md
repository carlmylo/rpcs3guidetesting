Next, you will be asked to confirm your account's creation. **Click "Yes"**.

Now **go to your email inbox to check for your verification token. The email will be called "Your token for RPCN"** You may have to wait a few minutes to get it. If you're still waiting, check your spam inbox.  
**Copy the token**:

## Managing Friends

Let's go over how to manage friends in RPCN.

Go to **Configuration > RPCN**
![A screenshot of RPCS3's Configuration with "RPCN" highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/rpcn/rpcn.png "RPCS3: RPCN")

Click on **Friends**.

![A screenshot of RPCS3's RPCN menu, with "Friends" highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/rpcn/friends.png "RPCS3: RPCN")

This will open the Friends window.

Once here, you can add friends in different ways including:

#### RPCN: Adding by Search

**To add a friend** by their username, **click on "Add Friend"**, at the bottom side of the RPCN: Friends window.

![A screenshot of RPCN's Friends window, with the user selecting "Add Friend".](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/rpcn/friendadd.png "RPCS3: Add Friend")

A popup will appear. **Type in your friend's username then click "OK".**

If you typed in their name correctly, you should see a "Friend added!" popup. The icon next to their name will be orange until they add you. **Once they accept your request, that's it!**

#### RPCN: Accepting Friend Requests

Any friend requests will be below "Friend Requests" in the RPCN:Friends window, with a yellow icon next to their name. **To accept any requests,** simply **right click the request and click "Accept Request."**

#### RPCN: Adding Recent Players

Any person you've played with that isn't already your friend will show up in the right side of the RPCN:Friends window.
To add anyone here, simply **right click the name and** you will be able to **send them a friend request.**
