# What is this?

A repository of premade controller profiles for RPCS3 to help newcomers to Rock Band 3. These files should be simple drag and drop configurations for controllers.

# How to install:
Before you install, **if you have any bindings in `config\input_configs\BLUS30463`, you should back them up because they will be overwritten.**

1. Download the .7z file in the folder for the instrument(s) you want to use.
2. Extract the .7z file.
3. Drag the `config` folder into the folder you have RPCS3 in.

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box but if they don't, try changing the controller listed in "`Devices`", next to the "`Refresh`" button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.

The profiles are formatted for single players. If you need to use a combination of various controllers for local multiplayer or want to quickly swap between multiple instruments, you can try the guide below for manually [[#mapping]](#mapping) additional controllers.

Alternatively, you can combine multiple files if you know your way around text editors like Notepad++ or Sublime Text.
Select everything from line 2 to the end of line 86 in the `Default.yml` file of the instrument you want to add, then copy it. 
Paste it into:
* Line 88 to 172 for Player 2
* Line 174 to 258 for Player 3
* Line 260 to 344 for Player 4
* Line 346 to 430 for Player 5
* Line 432 to 516 for Player 6
* Line 518 to 602 for Player 7
