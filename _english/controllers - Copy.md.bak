# Intro

**This section is for standard guitar controls, standard drums, and Xbox 360/Wii Pro Drums.**  
Pro Guitars and/or Keyboards are set up later.

If you're playing with a single instrument controller, consider visiting the [[Instrument Repo]](https://hmxmilohax.github.io/rb3-pc/english/instrumentrepo/), which has easy drag and drop profiles for various rhythm game instruments.

If not, keep reading.

**Right click on "Rock Band 3" and select "Create Custom Gamepad Configuration"**

![A screenshot of RPCS3's right click menu, showing "Create Custom Gamepad Configuration" highlighted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/conf/rpcs3pad.png "Create Custom Gamepad Configuration")

* If you are planning on plugging in multiple instruments, _you must set them on different ports_ (Player 1, Player 2, etc).
* PS3 guitar, drum controllers, and MIDI Pro Adapters **for the Rock Band series** are plug and play and require no additional setup.

**If your controller isn't being detected, click "Refresh". If that doesn't solve it, restart RPCS3.**

Once you've finished configuring, **remember to click "Save".**

Below are the buttons you should map in RPCS3's Gamepad Settings.

# Guitars  

* If you're using PS2 (Guitar Hero), PS3 (Guitar Hero), or Wii guitars, set the "Handlers" option to "MMJoyStick." 
* If you're using Xbox 360 guitar controllers, set the "Handlers" option to "XInput."

Make sure you **set "Device Class" to "Guitar".**  
**Switch the drop-down menu next to it to "Rock Band" if you're using a Rock Band guitar or leave it on "Guitar Hero" if you're using a Guitar Hero guitar**. 
 
**Some guitar controllers** (most notably Guitar Hero controllers) misbehave and **refuse to map sometimes. If you try mapping a button and get "U+", click "Filter Noise"** at the bottom left of the controller configuration window **then try mapping**.

# Drums

* If you're using PS3 (Guitar Hero), Wii, or Xbox 360 drum controllers, set the "Handlers" option to "MMJoyStick."
* If you're using a Xbox 360 MIDI Pro Adapter for drums, set the "Handlers" option to "XInput."

Make sure you **set "Device Class" to "Drum".**

**Switch** the drop-down menu next **to** it to **"Rock Band Pro"** if you're using a Rock Band kit **with or without cymbals**. **Do NOT use the regular "Rock Band" type.** **Leave it on "Guitar Hero" if you're using Guitar Hero drums.**

# Vocals  
*For vocals*, you can *use regular controllers*. If you're using a PS4 controller, switch to DS4. If you're using an Xbox One controller, switch to XInput. There's no need to remap anything. Alternatively, you can use a typing keyboard and refer to this guide to customize the mapping according to your preferences.

Here's what a _The Beatles: Rock Band Höfner_ Wii controller looks like when it's set up. Note that "Handlers" is set to "MMJoystick" and "Devices" is set to the correct Joystick number. Since it's a Rock Band guitar controller, "Device Class" is also set to "Guitar" and the box next to that is set to "Rock Band."
