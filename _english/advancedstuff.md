# Extra Guides

## Add more memory to Rock Band 3

### Intro

We'll be adding increased memory support to Rock Band 3 on RPCS3. This is strongly suggested and allows for better stability as well top of increasing the song limit up to 16000.

> ##### WARNING
>
> _If you downloaded and are using a [[Quick Configurations profile,]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/quickconfiguration/) this is already active and you don't need to do this._
{: .block-warning  }

> ##### DANGER
>
> _You need to [[enable Debug Console Mode in the Advanced Custom Configuration tab for Rock Band 3]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#advanced). **Not doing this will cause your game to crash immediately after adding this file.**_
{: .block-danger  }

### How To

* First, you'll need to [[download the file to enable increased memory support. Click here to download it]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/main/config/customconfig/memory.zip)

**After downloading the .zip file, extract its contents and move them to RPCS3's folder. It should combine folders automatically if you did it right.**

In the GIF example below, the `devhdd_0` folder from the archive (memory.zip) was extracted and its contents were moved into RPCS3's folder.

That's it! Enjoy the increased stability and extra song space!

## Add custom textures to Rock Band 3 Deluxe

### How To

## Move Game Files

### Intro:

If Rock Band 3's files are taking up too much space on your main drive, you can move them to a different drive while keeping RPCS3 itself on your main drive.

Make sure RPCS3 is closed before starting this.

First, create a folder where all of this stuff will be moved to.

I'll be naming the folder "RPCS3 Directory" in this tutorial.

![A screenshot of the folder created, which is named "RPCS3 Directory" in this tutorial.) en la categorÃ­a de 7-Zip.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/xtra/dir/dirfolder.png "RPCS3 Directory")

Now, back in the folder RPCS3 is in, cut the following folders:
* dev_bdvd
* dev_flash
* dev_flash2
* dev_flash3
* dev_hdd0
* dev_hdd1
* dev_usb000
* games

![A screenshot of the folders listed being cut.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/xtra/dir/dircut.png "Cut (CTRL+X")

Paste them inside of the folder you created.

![A GIF of the folders that were cut being pasted into the "RPCS3 Directory" folder.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/xtra/dir/dirpaste.gif "RPCS3 Directory")

When it finishes pasting, reopen RPCS3.

Click on Manage > Virtual File System

![A screenshot of RPCS3, with the user hovering over "Virtual File System", under the "Manage" category.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/xtra/dir/dirrpcs3.png "RPCS3 Directory")

In the Virtual File System window, click on the `+` symbol near the bottom right.

![A screenshot of RPCS3's Virtual File System Menu, showing the cursor hovering over the plus symbol at the bottom.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/xtra/dir/dirvfsadd.png "Virtual File System")

Go to the folder you created, click on it, and then click on "Select Folder."

![A screenshot of RPCS3's "Choose a directory" window, selecting the created folder.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/xtra/dir/dirfoldersel.png "RPCS3 Directory")

Finally, click "Save".

That's it!

## AshCentral Room Codes

### Intro

Video Version:  
[![A thumbnail of the video version of this section of the tutorial.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/vidthumb.png)](https://youtu.be/pfEUYhzw1ds "Rock Band 3 Multiplayer with Room Codes! [RPCS3] - YouTube")

**Room Codes are only useful for setting up private lobbies with console players. If you're inviting someone who's on an emulator, use the "Invite Friend" option in the "Play on AshCentral" menu!**

### Setting up for room codes on AshCentral

To use the room code system on AshCentral, **make sure RPCS3 is set to connect to AshCentral**. **Join the** [[**Milohax Discord server**]](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/discord) and **go to** the **[\[#ashcentral-status\]](https://discord.com/channels/961352072140324924/1153056600030973992)** channel.

**Copy the information into RPCS3** like mentioned in the [**[network]**](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration/#network) section of the guide.

Once you've done that, **go to** [**[AshCentral's website]**](https://gocentral.rocks/) **to register an account**.

[![A screenshot of AshCentral's website, GoCentral.Rocks, with the "Register" option from the "Account" subsection being moused over.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/splash.png)](https://gocentral.rocks/ "GoCentral")

**Register your account.**

You'll be taken back to the front page. **Under your account's name, you should see "Settings"**. Click on that.

[![A screenshot of AshCentral's website, GoCentral.Rocks, with the "Settings" option from the user name's subsection being moused over.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/splashsettings.png)](https://gocentral.rocks/settings "GoCentral")

**In the settings page, you'll see a "Link Account" option. Click on that.**

[![A screenshot of AshCentral's website, GoCentral.Rocks, in the account information subpage, with "Link Account" being moused over](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/settings.png)](https://gocentral.rocks/link "GoCentral")

This will take you to a page to type in an account linking code. **Leave this page open.**

[![A screenshot of AshCentral's website, GoCentral.Rocks, in the account linking subpage, with "Link" being moused over.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/link.png)](https://gocentral.rocks/link "GoCentral")

**Start up Rock Band 3**.

Once it launches, **go to the main options menu.**

![A screenshot of Rock Band 3, with Options being highlighted.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/options.png "Rock Band 3: Options")

**Go to the extras menu.**

![A screenshot of Rock Band 3, with extras being highlighted.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/extras.png "Rock Band 3: Extras")

**Go to "Account-linking code."**

![A screenshot of Rock Band 3, with "Account-Linking Code" being highlighted.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/accountlinkingcode.png "Rock Band 3: Account-Linking Code")

**You should see the code now.**

![A screenshot of Rock Band 3, telling the user to copy the code at the bottom into AshCentral.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/code.png "Rock Band 3: Code Here")

Now, **copy the code into Gocentral.Rocks, then click "Link." After that, restart Rock Band 3.**

![A screenshot of AshCentral's website, GoCentral.Rocks, in the account linking subpage, with "Link" being moused over.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/link.png "GoCentral - Link Account")

You'll be taken back to the front page. **Under your account's name, you should see "Settings"**. Click on that.

[![A screenshot of AshCentral's website, GoCentral.Rocks, with the "Settings" option from the user name's subsection being moused over.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/splashsettings.png)](https://gocentral.rocks/settings "GoCentral")

If you did everything correctly, **you should see more information for your account, including your account name, console, band name, and fans**.

![A screenshot of AshCentral's website, GoCentral.Rocks, in the account information subpage, showing new details under Rock Band 3 account.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/linked.png "GoCentral - Settings")

If the website didn't find anything, you may have mistyped the code. Rock Band 3's font may be a bit hard to read so you may have to try again.

Now, let's go over hosting or joining sessions.

**First, launch Rock Band 3** (if it's not already open).

**On the front page of AshCentral, click on "Join Game"**.

[![A screenshot of AshCentral's website, GoCentral.Rocks, with the "Join Game" being moused over.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/joingame.png)](https://gocentral.rocks/sessions "GoCentral")

**Before clicking either "Host Session" or "Join Session", make sure to press "Play on AshCentral" in Rock Band 3's options menu.**

![A screenshot of Rock Band 3, with "Play on AshCentral" being highlighted.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/main/assets/images/ash/ashcentral.png "Rock Band 3: Play on AshCentral")
