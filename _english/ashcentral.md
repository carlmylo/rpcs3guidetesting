## Intro

**If you're not interested in playing online or on AshCentral, skip to the [[next section]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/passthroughdevices/).**

This part of the guide **requires** that you have a [[**RPCN Account**]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/rpcn/) **and set your [[network configuration]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration#network) to use AshCentral server settings.**

AshCentral currently hosts the best experience for playing Rock Band 3 online. This part will be going over how to get the most out of your experience while playing online.

## Inviting Friends

Before sending or receiving invites, make sure you're online. For that, open the Start menu and press on "Play on AshCentral" to go online.

**Select any name.** It doesn't matter as **the actual friend you're sending an invite to will be on the next screen.**

**Here's where you actually select the friend you want to send an invite to.**

You will be asked to confirm if you want to send the message. **Press "Yes" to send it.**

Once your friend accepts the invite, they'll be in your session.

## Searching for random people

Searching for random players works just like it used to before:

**Go to Play Now > Quick Play > Find AshCentral Players**

## Room Codes

If you're an advanced user, you can use [[room codes]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/advancedstuff/#setting-up-for-room-codes-on-ashcentral) to connect with your friends. Please note that this is a much more complicated way to connect with each other and most people don't need to do this.
