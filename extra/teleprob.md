These are equipable items which are documented to have issues with visual glitches. Avoid these items if you don't want to have visual teleporting glitches.

## Microphones

Just about every single microphone has issues, **except the Clear Microphone**. This is the **only** microphone you want to use if you want to avoid teleporting.
