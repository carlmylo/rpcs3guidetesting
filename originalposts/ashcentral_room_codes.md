**Room Codes are only useful for setting up private lobbies with console players. If you're inviting someone who's on an emulator, use the "Invite Friend" option in the "Play on AshCentral" menu!**

### Setting up for room codes on AshCentral:

To use the room code system on AshCentral, **make sure RPCS3 is set to connect to AshCentral**. **Join the** [[**Milohax Discord server**]](https://rb3dx.neocities.org/discord) and **go to** the **[\[#ashcentral-status\]](https://discord.com/channels/961352072140324924/1153056600030973992)** channel.

**Copy the information into RPCS3** like mentioned in the [**[network]**](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/customconfiguration/#network) section of the guide.

Once you've done that, **go to** [**[AshCentral's website]**](https://gocentral.rocks/) **to register an account**.

**Start up Rock Band 3**.

Once it launches, **go the main options menu.**

If the website didn't find anything, you may have mistyped the code. Rock Band 3's font may be a bit hard to read so you may have to try again.

Now, let's go over hosting or joining sessions.

**First, launch Rock Band 3** (if it's not already open).

**On the front page of AshCentral, click on "Join Game"**.

**Before clicking either "Host Session" or "Join Session", make sure to press "Play on AshCentral" in Rock Band 3's options menu.**
