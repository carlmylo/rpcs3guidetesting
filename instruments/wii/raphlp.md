## NOTES:

* Tilt does not work. Various things have been attempted to get it to work, but the weird gyroscope configuration does not work well with RPCS3 and constantly inputs garbage.
* If the controller doesn't work at all, try installing [[Raphnet's management tool]](https://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/adapter_manager/index.php).
