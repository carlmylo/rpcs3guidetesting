## NOTES:

* Requires an electronic MIDI Drum Kit connected via USB or a MIDI to USB interface.
	* **Your MIDI Drum Kit needs to be set to MIDI Channel 10 and standard GM mapping.**  These should be default settings but consult the manual for your kit to make sure.
* Requires the latest version of [[RPCS3]](https://rpcs3.net/download)
* By default:
	* START: Hihat Pedal, Hihat Pedal, Hihat Pedal, Snare
	* SELECT: Hihat Pedal, Hihat Pedal, Hihat Pedal, Snare Rim
	* Song select shortcuts: Hihat Pedal, Hihat Pedal, Hihat Pedal, Kick

## Instructions:

**Right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, then click on ‚Äú**Change Custom Configuration**‚Äù.

	* ü•Å **Change your "Emulated MIDI type" from "Keyboard" to "Drums", then select your MIDI Electronic Drum Kit or MIDI to USB interface in the drop-down menu next to it**.

### Additional Setup:

You can adjust a variety of options in the `rb3drums.yml` file, located within the `config` folder inside your RPCS3 installation folder.

#### Remapping
If your drum kits have incompatible mapping, you can remap using `Midi id to note override: ""` with the corrected notes.
* To do this:
	* Go to [MIDI Monitor](https://www.midimonitor.com/)
	* Play the pad you want to replace to find its MIDI Note number ("Note #[number]").

The file uses the following note names:

`Kick`  
`HihatPedal`  
`Snare`  
`SnareRim`  
`HiTom`  
`LowTom`  
`FloorTom`  
`HihatWithPedalUp`  
`Hihat`  
`Ride`  
`Crash`

Examples of common replacements:
* Blue cymbal is mapped to `Note #51` and Green cymbals is mapped to `Note #49` and your kit has these reversed.
	* `Midi id to note override: "49=Ride,51=Crash"` will reverse them to be closer to the game's layout
* You want to map Open Hi-Hat to Blue cymbal.
	* `Midi id to note override: "46=Ride"`

In `rb3drums.yml`, you will find `Combo Start`, `Combo Select`, `Combo Toggle Hold Kick`, which allow you to customize the combos to activate their respective buttons.
