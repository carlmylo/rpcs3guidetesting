## NOTES:

* May need "Filter Noise" to bind correctly, depending on your luck. Sometimes the adapter is flooded by D-Pad presses.
* This has only been verified to work with an OSTENT PS1 PS2 To PC USB 2.0 Controller Adapter Converter For Sony PS2 Wired Controller (Model Number/SKU: 014800)
* Tilt does not work. Various things have been attempted to get it to work, but the weird gyroscope configuration does not work well with RPCS3 and constantly inputs garbage.
