## NOTES:

* This is for unknown controllers. You may have to use try different handlers until your controller is detected.
* To play Guitar/Bass/Keys on a Controller (Padtar), you will need Rock Band 3 Deluxe so you can pick them.
	- Additionally you can configure the layout within Rock Band 3 Deluxe's Advanced settings in-game.
