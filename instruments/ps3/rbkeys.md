## NOTES:

* It's strongly suggested you connect the keyboard with the dongle, if you have it. [[Click here for instructions on how to set that up.]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/english/passthroughdevices/)
* This is meant for players that have the keyboards connected via a MIDI to USB interface.
* None of the controller buttons will work as intended as the keyboard will be in MIDI mode.

## Instructions:
**Right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, then click on ‚Äú**Change Custom Configuration**‚Äù.

	* üéπ **Leave your "Emulated MIDI type" on "Keyboard" and select your MIDI interface in the drop-down menu next to it.**.

### Additional Information:

Since the keyboard controller buttons don't function like they do when connected with a dongle, you will have to shift octaves to access the buttons on the keys.

You can shift octaves with the Square and Circle buttons.
